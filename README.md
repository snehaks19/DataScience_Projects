1.Canada percapita income prediction
----------------------------------------
Predict canada's per capita income in year 2020. There is an exercise folder here on github at same level as this notebook, 
download that and you will find canada_per_capita_income.csv file. 

Using this build a regression model and predict the per capita income fo canadian citizens in year 2020

2.Hiring candidate's salary prediction
----------------------------------------
Dataset contains hiring statics for a firm such as experience of candidate, his written test score and personal interview score. Based on these 3 factors, HR will decide the salary. Given this data, you need to build a machine learning model for HR department that can help them decide salaries for future candidates. Using this predict salaries for following candidates,

a) 2 yr experience, 9 test score, 6 interview score

b) 12 yr experience, 10 test score, 10 interview score

3.Home price prediction
---------------------------
Build a predictor function to predict the price of a home that can take the sqr foot of the home and the name of the township as an input

1) with a 2800 sqr ft area in Robbinsville

2) with 3400 sqr ft area in west Windsor

4.Insurance
------------
Predicting if a person would buy life insurance based on his age using logistic regression

The dataset contains 2 columns with their age and whether they take life insurance or not

This is a binary logistic regression problem as there are only two possible outcomes (i.e. if person buys insurance or he/she doesn't).

5.HR Analytics
---------------
Finding Factors Affecting Employee Retention Rate 

1)done some exploratory data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)

2)Plotted bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention

3)Plotted bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention

4)Built logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in Step 1

5)Measured the accuracy of the model

6.Digit Prediction
--------------------
imported data set from scilearn_datasets

showed how to use sklearn logisticregression class to solve multiclass classification problem to predict hand written digit
